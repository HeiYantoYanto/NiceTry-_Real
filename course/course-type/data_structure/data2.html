                <p>Linear data structures organize elements in a sequential manner, where each element is connected to its previous and next element in a continuous progression. This arrangement ensures that data is stored and accessed in a predictable order, which simplifies traversal and manipulation. Common examples of linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and strings. In these structures, elements are typically processed one after another, making them highly intuitive and straightforward to implement. This ordered nature forms the foundation of many basic algorithms and computational processes.<br><br>

Each type of linear structure has its own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, arrays provide constant-time access to elements through indexing, but they have a fixed size, which can limit flexibility. Linked lists, on the other hand, allow dynamic memory allocation and easy insertion or deletion, though at the cost of slower access times. Stacks and queues serve as abstract data types built on linear structures, enforcing Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) disciplines, respectively. These properties make them well-suited for specific use cases, such as function call management in stacks or task scheduling in queues. Ultimately, linear structures act as a stepping stone for understanding more advanced, non-linear data structures, such as trees and graphs.
