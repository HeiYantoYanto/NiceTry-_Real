                <p>When we use computers, we are often dealing with information: numbers, names, files, or even images. But to use this information effectively, we need a way to store and organize it. This is where data structures come in. A data structure is simply a way to arrange and manage data so that it can be used efficiently. <br><br>
                Think of data structures like tools in a toolbox. Each tool has its own purpose: some are good for storing things, others for searching quickly, and others for arranging information neatly. For example, if you want to keep a list of names, you might use an array (like a row of lockers). If you need to connect data together, such as a train of linked cars, you might use a linked list. For faster searching, you could use a tree or a hash table, which are like maps that guide you straight to what youâ€™re looking for.<br><br>
                Data structures are the backbone of computer science. They affect how fast programs run, how much memory they use, and how reliable they are. Without them, even simple tasks like searching contacts on your phone or organizing files would take much longer.
