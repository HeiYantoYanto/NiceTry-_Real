               <p>Graph data structures consist of a set of vertices (nodes) connected by edges (links), representing complex relationships between entities. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and cyclic or acyclic. They are used to model networks like social connections, transportation systems, or web pages. Common operations include traversal (e.g., depth-first search or breadth-first search), pathfinding (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), and cycle detection. Graphs are highly flexible but can be computationally intensive to process, with time complexities often depending on the number of vertices and edges. They are implemented using adjacency matrices or adjacency lists, each with trade-offs in space and time efficiency. Graphs are essential for solving problems in computer science, from routing algorithms to recommendation systems, due to their ability to represent intricate interdependencies.<br><br>
